Many of us are victims of workers rights violation by the employer but the problem is left untreated due to lack of awareness to the rights, misunderstanding the paycheck and mostly laziness and unwillingness to deal with bureaurucracy and numbers.  

HERES WHERE TLUSHI COMES IN!

With Tlushi you can examine your paycheck only by tacking a photo of it.

In a short time you will recive email with a simple and clear report about the irregularities and violations of workers rights.
